<p>
This abstract interface is provided to simplify the implementation of {@model ECARule}s,
as EMF does not support type unions in metamodel definitions. It is also provided as a form
of syntactic sugar for using {@model ECARule}s.
</p>

<p>
For example, a {@model Button}
is an {@model ActionEdgeSource} to allow "onClick" {@model ECARule}s to be attached directly to the
{@model Button}, rather than the contained {@event onClick} {@model Event}.
