The {@model MapPoint#fieldValue} of the {@model MapPoint} is used as the location of the current point. If the {@model MapPoint#fieldValue} changes, the rendered map point will be refreshed to the new point. If the {@model MapPoint#fieldValue} of the {@model MapPoint} is empty, the map point will not be displayed. If the {@model MapPoint} is moved to a different location, the {@model MapPoint#fieldValue} of the {@model MapPoint} should also change, and the {@event onChange} {@model Event} will be triggered{@issue 225}.
