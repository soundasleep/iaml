A {@model Button} represents a clickable button in the user interface. A {@model Button} may accept and lose focus. The {@event onInput} {@model Event} can never be triggered for a {@model Button}. The {@model Button#fieldValue} of the {@model Button} is used as the caption for the rendered button, and may be changed at runtime.
