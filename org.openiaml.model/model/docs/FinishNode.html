An {@model ActivityOperation} may contain any number of {@model FinishNode}s. When the <i>execution flow</i> arrives at a {@model FinishNode}, the execution of the operation will finish successfully.

The {@model FinishNode} model element is based on the UML {@uml FinalNode} (activity final) model element.
