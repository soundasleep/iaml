<p>
An IAML model instance will have one {@model Role} with the {@model Role#name} of "User", representing the root {@model Role} type in an application, and this constraint may be satisfied through model completion. All {@model Role} instances in a model instance must inherit this {@model Role}.
</p>

<p>
By default, the ``User'' role will have a {@model DomainAttribute} with a {@model DomainAttribute#name} of "email", and a {@model DomainAttribute} with a {@model DomainAttribute#name} of "password", representing the e-mail address and user password of a user's profile respectively.
