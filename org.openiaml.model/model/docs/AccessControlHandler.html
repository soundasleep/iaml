<p>
A {@model AccessControlHandler} has an associated <i>user instance</i> {@model DomainIterator}, which will only be populated when the current user satisfies the <i>access requirements</i> of the handler.
</p>

<p>
A {@model AccessControlHandler} may have an outgoing {@model ActionEdge} {@model ActionEdge#name}d ``login''. If the current user does not satisfy the <i>access requirements</i> of this {@model AccessControlHandler}, the {@model ActionEdge} is executed.
