<p>
An {@model ActivityOperation} may contain any number of {@model SplitNode}s. Each {@model SplitNode} must have at least one outgoing {@model ExecutionEdge}. Each outgoing {@model ExecutionEdge} is defined as a separate <i>thread</i> with respect to that particular {@model SplitNode}, and every thread must eventually terminate at a {@model JoinNode}.
</p>

<p>
When the <i>execution flow</i> arrives at a {@model SplitNode}, each outgoing thread will be executed according to some multithreaded policy, with each of these executed threads inserted into a <i>thread set</i> associated with the {@model SplitNode}. Every thread has an associated <i>execution flow</i>. No guarantee is given as to the order in which each thread is executed, nor that any number of threads will execute simultaneously or that the implementation is actually within a multithreaded environment.
</p>

<p>
The {@model SplitNode} element is based off the UML {@uml ForkNode} model element.
