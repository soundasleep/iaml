An IAML model instance will have one \modelLink{Role} with the \modelProperty{Role}{name} of ``User'', representing the root \modelLink{Role} type in an application, and this constraint may be satisfied through model completion. All \modelLink{Role} instances in a model instance must inherit this \modelLink{Role}. 

By default, the ``User'' role will have a \modelLink{Domain Attribute} with a \modelProperty{Domain Attribute}{name} of ``email'', and a \modelLink{Domain Attribute} with a \modelProperty{Domain Attribute}{name} of ``password'', representing the e-mail address and user password respectively.
