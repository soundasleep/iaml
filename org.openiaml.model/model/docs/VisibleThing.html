All {@model VisibleThing}s may be <i>rendered</i> to a user. When a {@model VisibleThing} is rendered to a user, all children {@model VisibleThing}s must also be rendered in order according to their {@model VisibleThing#renderOrder}. A {@model VisibleThing} that is currently <i>hidden</i> must not be rendered until that {@model VisibleThing} is subsequently <i>shown</i>. The {@model VisibleThing#name} of the {@model VisibleThing} may be used as a label for the rendered element.
