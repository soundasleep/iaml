An {@model ActivityParameter} defines a {@model ActivityParameter#name} and associated {@model ActivityParameter#type}. When an {@model ActivityOperation} is being executed, the incoming {@model ECARule} can support incoming named {@model Parameter}s in order to set these named operation parameters; parameters are passed by value, and not by reference. The values of these {@model ActivityParameter}s do not persist across operation calls.
