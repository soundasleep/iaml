A bridge is necessary between {@model ActivityNode}s and {@model Value}s as it should be possible to
access values outside of an {@model ActivityOperation} or {@model ActivityPredicate}, without having to
define all {@model Value}s as a {@model DataFlowEdgesSource} or {@model DataFlowEdgeDestination}.
