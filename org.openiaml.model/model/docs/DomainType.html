<p>
A {@model DomainType} can be composed of many {@model DomainAttribute}s, each of which has a particular <i>data type</i>. Foreign keys are supported by declaring that a given {@model DomainAttribute}s extends another through an {@model ExtendsEdge}. A {@model DomainType} can <i>extend</i> another {@model DomainType} through an {@model ExtendsEdge} to describe a simple form of inheritance. Multiple inheritance is supported, but circular inheritance is not allowed.
