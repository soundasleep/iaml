# Introduction #

SimpleGMF is a domain-specific modelling language, implemented in EMF and openArchitectureWare, which simplifies the development of GMF model instances for diagram editors that use diagram partitioning and span many individual diagram editor plugins.

Currently this project is still fairly undocumented, however you can download the source code.

# Metamodel #

The SimpleGMF metamodel is implemented in [simplegmf.ecore](http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf/model/simplegmf.ecore).

# Implementation #

The current implementation of SimpleGMF is available through the IAML source code repository online:

  * http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf/
  * http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf.codegen/
  * http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf.editor/ (generated by EMF)
  * http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf.edit/ (generated by EMF)
  * http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.simplegmf.tests/

# Download #

There is currently no standalone implementation of SimpleGMF, however such a package may be released in the future.
