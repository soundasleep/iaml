An IAML model instance must contain at least one \modelLink{Internet Application}. The \event{onInit} \modelLink{Event Trigger} for an \modelLink{Internet Application} is only executed once over the lifetime of the deployed application, and will not be triggered even if the application host is restarted.

The \textit{storage semantics} for a \modelLink{Internet Application} are as follows: For a \modelLink{Value} directly contained within a \modelLink{Internet Application}, any stored value is accessible globally; that is, across all clients, all browsers, all sessions and all requests over the lifetime of the deployed application. Similarly, a \modelLink{Domain Iterator} is also accessible globally.
