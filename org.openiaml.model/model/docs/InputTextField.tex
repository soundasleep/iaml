An \modelLink{Input Text Field} represents a user-editable text field in the user interface. An \modelLink{Input Text Field} may accept and lose focus. The \event{onInput} \modelLink{Event Trigger} may be triggered according to the semantics of \event{onInput} (\sectionref{section:model-events-onInput}). The \modelProperty{Input Text Field}{name} of the \modelLink{Input Text Field} may be used as a label for the rendered text field. The \modelProperty{Input Text Field}{field value} of the \modelLink{Button} is used as the current value of the rendered text field, and may be changed at runtime.
