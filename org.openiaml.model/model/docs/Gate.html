<p>
A {@model Scope} may contain a single entry {@model Gate} through {@model Scope#entryGate}, and a single exit {@model Gate} through {@model Scope#exitGate}.
</p>

<h3>Entry Gate</h3>

<p>
An entry {@model Gate} must have at least one outgoing {@model ECARule} which has a destination of a {@model Frame}; this first target {@model Frame} represents the <i>incoming gate</i>. If an entry {@model Gate} is executed as an {@model Action}, and the entry {@model Gate} has been <i>satisfied</i>, the browser is redirected to the {@model Frame} which triggered the entry {@model Gate} (the <i>resume location</i>). If the satisfied entry {@model Gate} was not triggered by a {@model Frame}, or the entry {@model Gate} is not satisfied, then the browser is redirected to the <i>incoming gate</i>.
</p>

<p>
When a {@model Frame} directly contained within this {@model Scope} is accessed or rendered, this entry {@model Gate} must first be satisfied; that is, all incoming {@model Conditions}s must be considered <i>successful</i>. If the entry {@model Gate} is not satisfied, , then the <i>failure rules</i> of that exit {@model Gate} are executed in descending {@model ECARule#priority} order according to the execution semantics of {@model ECARule}.
</p>

<p>
If an entry {@model Gate} is executed as an {@model Action}, and the entry {@model Gate} has been <i>satisfied</i>, the browser is redirected to the {@model Frame} which triggered the entry {@model Gate} (the <i>resume location</i>). If the satisfied entry {@model Gate} was not triggered by a {@model Frame}, or the entry {@model Gate} is not satisfied, then the browser is redirected to the <i>incoming gate</i>.
</p>

<!-- "first" Entry Gate -->

<p>
An entry {@model Gate} may have an outgoing {@model ECARule} to a {@model Frame} with an {@model ECARule#name} "first". This {@model Frame} must reside outside of the containing {@model Scope} of that {@model Gate}. When this model is completed through <i>model completion</i>, this entry {@model Gate} will be extended to first check that the current user has successfully visited this {@model Frame}.
</p>

<h3>Exit Gate</h3>

<p>
An exit {@model Gate} must have at least one outgoing {@model ECARule} which has a destination of a {@model Frame}; this first target {@model Frame} represents the <i>outgoing gate</i>. If an exit {@model Gate} is executed as an {@model Action}, and the exit {@model Gate} has been <i>satisfied</i>, the browser is redirected to the {@model Frame} which triggered the exit {@model Gate} (the <i>resume location</i>). If the satisfied exit {@model Gate} was not triggered by a {@model Frame}, or the exit {@model Gate} is not satisfied, then the browser is redirected to the <i>outgoing gate</i>.
</p>

<p>
When a {@model Frame} within the model, but not contained (directly or indirectly) within that {@model Scope} is accessed or rendered, this exit {@model Gate} must first be satisfied; that is, all incoming {@model Conditions}s must be considered <i>successful</i>. If the exit {@model Gate} is not satisfied, then the <i>failure rules</i> of that exit {@model Gate} are executed in descending {@model ECARule#priority} order according to the execution semantics of {@model ECARule}.
</p>

<p>
If an exit {@model Gate} is executed as an {@model Action}, and the exit {@model Gate} has been <i>satisfied</i>, the browser is redirected to the {@model Frame} which triggered the exit {@model Gate} (the <i>resume location</i>). If the satisfied exit {@model Gate} was not triggered by a {@model Frame}, or the exit {@model Gate} is not satisfied, then the browser is redirected to the <i>outgoing gate</i>.
</p>

<!-- "last" Exit Gate -->

<p>
A exit {@model Gate} may have an outgoing {@model ECARule} to a {@model Frame} with a {@model ECARule#name} "last". This {@model Frame} must reside within the containing {@model Scope} of that exit {@model Gate}. When this model is completed through <i>model completion</i>, the exit {@model Gate} will be extended to first check that the current user has successfully visited this {@model Frame}.
