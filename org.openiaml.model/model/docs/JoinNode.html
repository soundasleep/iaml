<p>
An {@model ActivityOperation} may contain any number of {@model JoinNode}s. Each {@model JoinNode} must have at least one incoming {@model ExecutionEdge}, and at least one outgoing {@model ExecutionEdge}.
</p>

<p>
If an executing thread arrives at a {@model JoinNode}, the thread will be removed from the associated <i>thread set</i> of that thread. If the <i>thread set</i> is not empty, execution of the thread will be suspended until such a point that the <i>thread set</i> is empty. If the <i>thread set</i> is empty, then the multithreaded execution originating from the original {@model SplitNode} will be considered complete, and the <i>execution flow</i> will continue from the {@model SplitNode} as normal. If an <i>unthreaded</i> <i>execution flow</i> arrives at a {@model JoinNode}, an exception must occur.
</p>

<p>
The {@model JoinNode} element is based off the UML {@uml JoinNode} model element.
