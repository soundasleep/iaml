# Introduction #

In IAML, there are two types of operations: **Primitive** operations, and **Composite** operations.

**[Primitive Operations](IamlPrimitiveOperations.md)** are the fundamental building blocks of application functionality.

**[Composite Operations](IamlCompositeOperations.md)** are built up with a combination of primitive operations, decisions, branching and loops.

In particular, primitive operations have a fixed semantics and cannot be changed (without modifying IAML inference and code generation logic); whereas composite operations have a default semantics, but can be [changed if necessary](ModelInference.md).
