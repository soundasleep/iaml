An {@model Email} is designed to be used in the composition and delivery of mail messages<!-- , according to RFC 2821 \cite{rfc2821}-->. An {@model Email} has five directly contained {@model Value}s, all of which must be {@model Value#type} {@type string}:

<ul>
  <li>{@model Email#from}, representing the e-mail address of the sender. This {@model Value} <i>must</i> be set for an {@model Email} to be sent.
  <li>{@model Email#fromName}, representing a human-readable name of the sender. This {@model Value} is optional.
  <li>{@model Email#to}, representing the e-mail address of the receiver. This property <i>must</i> be set for an {@model Email} to be sent
  <li>{@model Email#toName}, representing a human-readable name of the receiver. This {@model Value} is optional.
  <li>{@model Email#subject}, representing the subject of the mail message. This {@model Value} <i>must</i> be set for an {@model Email} to be sent.
</ul>

An {@model Email} contains the {@model Operation} {@model Email#send}, which will attempt to deliver the current {@model Email} instance as described by {@model PrimitiveOperation}. When an {@model Email} is composed, the \textit{body} of the {@model Email} will be composed of all contained {@model Value}s and their values at the time the {@model Email} was sent. The format of this body may use a \textit{custom template} if this template is specified.

An {@model Email} contains the {@model Event}s {@event onSent} and {@event onFailure}. These events are triggered once an {@model Email} has been successfully delivered and when an {@model Email} is unsuccessfully received, as discussed by {@model Event}.

<!-- TODO Email.onInit is never actually defined in the code templates -->
An IAML model instance may contain any number of {@model Email}s. The <i>storage semantics</i> for a {@model Email} follow the storage semantics for its <i>containing scope</i>, similar to the <i>storage semantics</i> for the {@model Frame} element.
