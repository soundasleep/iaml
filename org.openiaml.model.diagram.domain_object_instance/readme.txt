
NOTE: Not all of the files in this directory are provided in order
for the entire Eclipse plugin to function correctly. Since we are
using GMF, most of the Eclipse plugin code is automatically generated.

Files which are fully generated and are not customised in any way
are therefore not included in the SVN repository.

You will need to regenerate the code yourself, or download a source
zip or build release in order for this project to function 
correctly.
