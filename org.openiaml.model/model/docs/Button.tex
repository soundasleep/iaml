A \modelLink{Button} represents a clickable button in the user interface. A \modelLink{Button} may accept and lose focus. The \event{onInput} \modelLink{Event Trigger} can never be triggered for a \modelLink{Button}. The \modelProperty{Button}{field value} of the \modelLink{Button} is used as the caption for the rendered button, and may be changed at runtime.
