<p>
When the results of a {@model SelectWire} are evaluated, the resulting result set 
is not stored in memory. That is, if the underlying view changes (objects are inserted
or removed), the users' view will be updated accordingly. For example, 
{@model #next next()} will skip over deleted results, possibly undesirably.
</p> 

<p>
You are therefore advised to use the "hasNext" and "hasPrevious" {@model PrimitiveCondition}s
that are provided in the {@model DomainObjectInstance}, and connecting a
{@model NavigateWire fail wire} if necessary.
