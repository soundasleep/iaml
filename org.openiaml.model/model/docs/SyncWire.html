A {@model SyncWire} is a bidirectional {@model Wire}, that may connect any two {@model CanBeSynced} model elements. When the intended model is completed through <i>model completion</i>, a {@model SyncWire} will include elements necessary to keep the values of two associated {@model CanBeSynced} elements synchronised.

A {@model SyncWire} will synchronise the {@model CanBeSynced} elements contained within each of the synchronised elements. That is, if a {@model CanBeSynced} element (the <i>triggering element</i>) contained within one {@model SyncWire}-connected element (the <i>source container</i>) does not have an associated {@model CanBeSynced} element within the other {@model SyncWire}-connected element (the <i>target container</i>), then the following process will occur:

<ol>
  <li>For a {@model SyncWire}, a <i>default element</i> will be created within the <i>target container</i>, as follows:

  <ol>
    <li>If both the <i>source container</i> and the <i>target container</i> are {@model VisibleThing}s, then the type of the <i>default element</i> will be the same as the type of the <i>triggering element</i>.

    <li>If the <i>source container</i> is a {@model DomainIterator} and the <i>target container</i> is a {@model InputForm}, then the type of the <i>default element</i> will be a {@model InputTextField}.
  </ol>

  <li>A new {@model SyncWire} will be generated by the original {@model SyncWire}. This new {@model SyncWire} will connect the generated <i>default element</i> to the triggering element in the <i>source</i> container.

  <li>Any incoming {@model Condition}s and {@model Parameter}s to the original {@model SyncWire} will be duplicated with respect to the newly-created {@model SyncWire}.
</ol>

If a {@model DomainIterator} iterating over multiple results is connected to a {@model InputForm} with a {@model SyncWire} or {@model SetWire}, then the form will be populated in such a way to provide navigation over the data set. That is, {@model Button}s will be created within the form to control the cursor over the iterator.
