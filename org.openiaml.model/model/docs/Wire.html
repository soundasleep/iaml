<p>
A {@model Wire} is an abstract connection that represents additional functionality of a common web application design pattern, as defined by the subtype of the {@model Wire}. A {@model Wire} connects a {@model WireSource} to a {@model WireDestination}; this relationship may be unidirectional (such as a {@model SetWire}) or bidirectional (such as a {@model SyncWire}). <!-- similarly, a {@model Wire} may optionally be provided a number of incoming parameters, as specified through {@model Parameter}s. -->
</p>

<p>
A {@model Wire} may optionally be constrained by a number of incoming {@model Predicate}s, as specified through {@model Condition}s; these incoming {@model Predicate}s will be subsequently applied to all {@model ECARule}s generated through that {@model Wire}.
