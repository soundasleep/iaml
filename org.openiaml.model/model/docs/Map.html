<p>
A {@model Map} represents a geographical map location that should be interactive -- that is, the map can be navigated from within the browser. A {@model Map} may accept and lose focus. The {@event onInput} {@model Event} can never be triggered for a {@model Map}. A {@model Map} may contain any number of {@model MapPoint}s, all which will be rendered within the current {@model Map} as separate points.
</p>

<p>
The {@model Map#fieldValue} of the {@model Map} is used as the location for the rendered map. If the {@model Map#fieldValue} changes, the location of the map will be refreshed to the new location. If the {@model Map#fieldValue} of the {@model Map} is empty, the map will revert to a default location. When the current location of the rendered map changes, the {@model Map#fieldValue} of the {@model Map} should also change, and the {@event onChange} {@model Event} will be triggered{@issue 225}.
