<p>
A {@model VisibleThing} is the abstract type for interface modelling, and may directly contain other {@model VisibleThing}s as its {@model VisibleThing#children}. All {@model VisibleThing}s may be <i>rendered</i> to a user. When a {@model VisibleThing} is rendered to a user, all children {@model VisibleThing}s must also be rendered in order according to their {@model VisibleThing#renderOrder}. A {@model VisibleThing} that is currently <i>hidden</i> must not be rendered until that {@model VisibleThing} is subsequently <i>shown</i>. The {@model VisibleThing#name} of the {@model VisibleThing} may be used as a label for the rendered element.
</p>

<p>
All {@model VisibleThing}s define the {@model VisibleThing#hide}, {@model VisibleThing#show}, {@model VisibleThing#init} and {@model VisibleThing#update} {@model Operations}, which are implemented as {@model PrimitiveOperation}s. All {@model VisibleThing}s also define the {@model VisibleThing#empty} and {@model VisibleThing#notEmpty} {@model Predicates}, which are implemented as {@model BuiltinProperty}s.
