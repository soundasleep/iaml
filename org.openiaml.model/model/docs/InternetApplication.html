<p>
An IAML model instance must contain a single instance of an {@model InternetApplication}. The {@event onInit} {@model Event} for an {@model InternetApplication} is only executed once over the lifetime of the deployed application, and will not be triggered even if the application host is restarted.

<!--index storage semantics-->
The <i>storage semantics</i> for a {@model InternetApplication} are as follows: For a {@model Value} directly contained within a {@model InternetApplication}, any stored value is accessible globally; that is, across all clients, all browsers, all sessions and all requests over the lifetime of the deployed application. Similarly, a {@model DomainIterator} is also accessible globally.
