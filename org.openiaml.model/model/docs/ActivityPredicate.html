<p>
An {@model ActivityPredicate} may be defined through the composition of a number of {@model ActivityNode}s, connected by {@model ExecutionEdge}s and {@model DataFlowEdge}s. {@model ExecutionEdge}s represent the <i>execution flow</i> of the particular condition, and {@model DataFlowEdge}s represent the flow of data within the particular condition.
</p>

<p>
The definition of a {@model ActivityPredicate} is identical to a {@model ActivityOperation}, except on the behaviours of {@model FinishNode}s and {@model CancelNode}s. If the execution flow of a {@model ActivityPredicate} arrives at a {@model FinishNode}, the {@model Predicate} is taken to be <i>successful</i> and return <code>true</code>. Similarly, if the execution flow of a {@model ActivityPredicate} arrives at a {@model CancelNode}, the {@model Predicate} is taken to be <i>unsuccessful</i> and return <code>false</code>.
