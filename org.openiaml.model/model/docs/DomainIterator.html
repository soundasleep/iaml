<p>
When the results of a {@model SelectWire} are evaluated, the resulting result set
is not stored in memory. That is, if the underlying view changes (objects are inserted
or removed), the users' view will be updated accordingly. For example,
{@model DomainObjectInstance#next next()} will skip over deleted results, possibly undesirably.
</p>

<p>
You are therefore advised to use the "hasNext" and "hasPrevious" {@model PrimitiveCondition}s
that are provided in the {@model DomainIterator}, and connecting a
{@model NavigateAction fail wire} if necessary.

A variety of query functions are provided:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Returns</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>matches(a,b)</code></td>
  <td>Performs a case-insensitive text search of <code>a</code> against the query <code>b</code>. Every word in <code>b</code> is matched, usually using a SQL keyword or function <code>LIKE</code>, against <code>a</code>.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
