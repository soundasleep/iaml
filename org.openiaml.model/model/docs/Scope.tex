When a \modelLink{Scope} is rendered, the lifecycle events for that \modelLink{Scope} must be executed in the following order. If a failure occurs during this process, the current lifecycle execution process is cancelled and the \textit{failure handler} for the current \modelLink{Scope} is executed. If an \modelLink{Action Edge} is executed which must redirect the user to another \modelLink{Frame}, the current lifecycle execution process is cancelled.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If this \modelLink{Scope} is contained by a parent \modelLink{Scope}, then the pre-render lifecycle events for that parent \modelLink{Scope} must be triggered.
  
  \item If this \modelLink{Scope} has not yet been \textit{initialised} according to the storage semantics of that \modelLink{Scope}, then the \event{onInit} \modelLink{Event Trigger} is triggered. 

  \item The \event{onAccess} \modelLink{Event Trigger} is triggered.

  \item All \modelLink{Entry Gates} contained within this \modelLink{Scope} are sorted according to their \modelProperty{Entry Gate}{name}. The \textit{access semantics} of each \modelLink{Entry Gate} are then executed.

  \item All \modelLink{Exit Gates} contained within this \modelLink{Scope} are sorted according to their \modelProperty{Exit Gate}{name}. The \textit{access semantics} of each \modelLink{Exit Gate} are then executed.
  
  \item The \modelLink{Scope} is then rendered.
\end{enumerate}
