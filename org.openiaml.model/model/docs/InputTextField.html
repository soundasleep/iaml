<p>
An {@model InputTextField} represents a user-editable text field in the user interface. An {@model InputTextField} may accept and lose focus. The {@event onInput} {@model Event} may be triggered according to the semantics of {@event onInput}. The {@model InputTextField#name} of the {@model InputTextField} may be used as a label for the rendered text field. The {@model InputTextField#fieldValue} of the {@model Button} is used as the current value of the rendered text field, and may be changed at runtime.
