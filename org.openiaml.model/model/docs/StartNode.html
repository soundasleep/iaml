An {@model ActivityOperation} must contain exactly one {@model StartNode}, which must have at least one outgoing {@model ExecutionEdge}. When the {@model ActivityOperation} is executed, the <i>execution flow</i> will begin from this {@model StartNode}, and will follow each outgoing {@model ExecutionEdge} sequentially.

The {@model StartNode} element is based on the UML {@uml InitialNode} model element.
