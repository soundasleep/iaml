<p>
This abstract interface is provided to simplify the implementation of the IAML proof-of-concept
editor within EMF as GMF, by moving common containment relationships into a single abstract supertype. In particular:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Within EMF, all instances of model edges (such as {@model ECARule}s and {@modelWire}s)
should be contained within another model element to prevent the edges from polluting the top-level
{@emf EResource} of the model instance (known as <i>phantom nodes</i> within EMF: see GMF bug 284135).</li>
  <li>Within GMF, it is much simplier to support the creation of edge elements if the edge
is contained within the element representing the edge source, rather than an arbitrary container
elsewhere in the metamodel (GMF bug 249717).
</ol>
