IAML, the _Internet Application Modelling Language_, is an MDA-compliant modelling language for Rich Internet Applications, and has been the focus of PhD research at [Massey University](http://engineering.massey.ac.nz/), New Zealand.

As part of this research, we are developing a model editor in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) using the [GMF framework](http://www.eclipse.org/gmf/), which will demonstrate our modelling language prototypes.

Once you have [installed the plugin](Installation.md) and [installed PHP](InstallationPlatform.md), you can try the language with a [Hello World application](HelloWorld.md). More [documentation](http://code.google.com/p/iaml/w/list?q=label:EndUser) is forthcoming.

**[Version 0.6](http://code.google.com/p/iaml/wiki/Model0_6#Model_0.6)** of the plugin has been [released](http://journals.jevon.org/users/jevon-phd/entry/19917) (September 2011), and can be [installed into Eclipse](Installation.md).
