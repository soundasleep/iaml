<p>
A {@model Scope} may contain at most one {@model AccessControlHandler}. All access to elements within this {@model Scope}, or its children {@model Scope}s, must first <i>satisfy</i> the {@model AccessControlHandler}. A {@model AccessControlHandler} must have at least one outgoing {@model RequiresEdge}, and each {@model RequiresEdge} must connect to either a {@model Role} or {@model Permission}.
</p>

<p>
A {@model RequiresEdge} may be connected to another {@model RequiresEdge} with a {@model ConstraintEdge} in order to support the composition of complex conditions. The composition of these outgoing {@model RequiresEdge}s with any connecting {@model ConstraintEdge}s represent the <i>access requirements</i> of the {@model AccessControlHandler}.
</p>

<p>
A {@model AccessControlHandler} has an associated <i>user instance</i> {@model DomainIterator}, which will only be populated when the current user satisfies the <i>access requirements</i> of the handler.
</p>

<p>
A {@model AccessControlHandler} may have an outgoing {@model ECARule} {@model ECARule#name}d ``login''. If the current user does not satisfy the <i>access requirements</i> of this {@model AccessControlHandler}, the {@model ECARule} is executed.
