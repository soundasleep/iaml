A \modelLink{Map Point} represents a list of elements retrieved from a particular \modelLink{Domain Iterator}. A \modelLink{Iterator List} must be connected to a \modelLink{Domain Iterator} via either a \modelLink{Set Wire} or \modelLink{Sync Wire}; this iterator becomes the \textit{connected iterator}. A \modelLink{Iterator List} may accept and lose focus. The \event{onInput} \modelLink{Event Trigger} can never be triggered for a \modelLink{Iterator List}.

When a \modelLink{Iterator List} is rendered, the number of results from the \textit{connected iterator} is obtained; all of the children directly contained in this \modelLink{Iterator List} will be rendered as many times. These elements will be rendered in a table or grid style, with the \modelProperty{Visible Thing}{name} of each child element used as a heading.
