All \modelLink{Visible Things} may be \textit{rendered} to a user. When a \modelLink{Visible Thing} is rendered to a user, all children \modelLink{Visible Things} must also be rendered in order according to their \modelProperty{Visible Thing}{render order}. A \modelLink{Visible Thing} that is currently \textit{hidden} must not be rendered until that \modelLink{Visible Thing} is subsequently \textit{shown}. The \modelProperty{Visible Thing}{name} of the \modelLink{Visible Thing} may be used as a label for the rendered element.
