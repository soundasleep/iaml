==Runtime Library==

Since r888, IAML provides a separate runtime library plugin which can be aliased to a virtual folder to improve performance. To enable this, you will need to set up an alias on your web server to the IAML client-side runtime libraries (similar to Symfony's /sf virtual folder):

{{{
# iaml library include (client-side)
Alias "/iaml-runtime" "C:/.../org.openiaml.model.runtime/src/web"
<Directory "C:/.../org.openiaml.model.runtime/src/web">
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   DirectoryIndex index.html index.php default.html default.php
   AllowOverride All
   Allow from All   
</Directory>
}}}

To make your project use these libraries, set "include_runtime" to "false" in your project properties, and set "config_runtime" and "config_web" appropriately. See: [IamlProjectProperties]
